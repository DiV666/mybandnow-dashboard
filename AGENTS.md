# Repository Guidelines

## How to Use This Guide

- This is the single AGENTS.md for **scaffolding** — a Node.js 22 / TypeScript 5.4 microservice template with Hexagonal Architecture and DDD.
- `src/AGENTS.md` contains implementation patterns: layer rules, naming conventions, decision trees, QA checklist.
- `docs/AGENTS.md` contains the documentation style guide: writing conventions, ADR format, feature doc format.
- Those files override this one when guidance conflicts.

## Engram Persistent Memory

**MANDATORY RULE:** If you attempt to use Engram (e.g., `mem_save` or CLI) and receive an `unknown_project` error indicating that the project is not backed by known context, YOU MUST INITIALIZE IT IMMEDIATELY. Do not stop or ask the user. Run the following command in the terminal to initialize it:

```bash
engram save "Init project" "Initializing the project in engram" --type config --project <project-name>
```

Then proceed with your original task or save operation.

## Project Overview

**scaffolding** is a REST microservice following strict Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) with Domain-Driven Design.

| Item            | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Runtime         | Node.js 22 / TypeScript 5.4 |
| Framework       | Express 5 + openapi-backend |
| Database        | MongoDB 6                   |
| Messaging       | RabbitMQ (amqplib)          |
| Auth            | Keycloak JWT (BearerAuth)   |
| DI container    | node-dependency-injection   |
| Test runner     | Vitest 3 / Cucumber 12      |
| Build           | ESBuild                     |
| API port (dev)  | 4008                        |
| Swagger UI port | 4009                        |

### Architecture — Hexagonal (strict)

```
apps/          → Entry points; imports application layer only
application/   → Use cases (commands, queries, handlers); imports domain only
domain/        → Aggregates, value objects, domain events, repository interfaces; NO external imports
infrastructure → Concrete implementations (MongoDB, RabbitMQ, HTTP providers); imports domain only
```

### Module structure

Every module follows:

```
Contexts/Communicator/<ModuleName>/
├── application/      # Commands, queries, handlers
├── domain/           # Aggregates, value objects, domain events, repository interfaces
└── infrastructure/   # MongoDB repos, HTTP providers, etc.
```

---

## Development

```bash
# Start dependencies (MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Keycloak)
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
make unit-tests          # Unit tests only (no infra required)
make integration-tests   # Integration tests (requires Docker services)
make acceptance-tests    # E2E Cucumber tests (requires Docker services)
make tests               # All three
```

### Security Audits

```bash
make audit       # Informational audit (for local development)
make audit-ci    # Strict audit with allowlist (for CI/CD)
```

#### Allowed Vulnerabilities

We temporarily allow the following npm advisories (managed via `.audit-ci.json`):

- **GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg** (`braces`, high)
  - **Reason**: Transitive dependency via `cpx` → `chokidar` → `anymatch` → `micromatch` → `braces`. Waiting for upstream fix.
  - **Expires**: 2026-07-15
  - **Tracking**: https://github.com/mysticatea/cpx/issues

- **GHSA-952p-6rrq-rcjv** (`micromatch`, moderate)
  - **Reason**: Transitive dependency via `cpx` → `chokidar` → `anymatch` → `micromatch`. Waiting for upstream fix.
  - **Expires**: 2026-07-15

The CI script resolves advisory IDs from `npm audit --json` and applies them transitively to affected packages such as `anymatch`, `chokidar`, `cpx`, and `readdirp`.

**How it works:**
- `make audit`: runs `npm audit` against the public npm registry (informational only, does not block)
- `make audit-ci`: runs `./build-tools/audit-ci.sh` which checks `npm audit --json` output against `.audit-ci.json` GHSA allowlist entries with expiration dates
- If a vulnerability is NOT in the allowlist or has expired, CI/CD will fail
- Prefer adding exceptions under `advisory-allowlist` using the GHSA ID as the key and `{ "expiresOn": "YYYY-MM-DD", "reason": "..." }` as the value
- `package-allowlist` remains available only as a backward-compatible fallback for cases where no GHSA ID can be resolved

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow conventional-commit style: `<type>[scope]: <description>`

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `refactor`, `style`, `test`

**Scopes:** `core`, `config`, `events`, `auth`, `shared`

**Format:** one-line only — no body, no footer. Example:

```
feat(core): add PUT /v1/entities/{id} update endpoint
fix(core): correct EntityUpdate silent no-op
```

Before creating a PR:

1. Run all relevant tests and linters (`make unit-tests` at minimum)
2. Ensure no sensitive data appears in logs

### Git Commit Rules

**NEVER use `git commit --no-verify` unless explicitly instructed by the user.**

The pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) executes:
1. `npm run format:fix` — auto-fixes ESLint issues
2. `gga run` — AI code review (Gentleman Guardian Angel)

These checks are **mandatory** to maintain code quality. Skipping them bypasses:
- Code formatting consistency
- AI-powered code review
- Protection against common mistakes

If the pre-commit hook fails:
- Fix the issues reported by ESLint or GGA
- Do NOT bypass with `--no-verify`
- Only use `--no-verify` if the user explicitly requests it

## Security Checklist (per change)

- **Input validation at boundaries**: validate all incoming data at controllers via OpenAPI schema (`definition.json`).
- **No secrets in code**: credentials always come from environment variables validated by Zod at startup.
- **No sensitive data in logs**: never log personal data or sensitive content in plain form. Mask or omit any PII before logging.
- **Domain value objects enforce invariants**: use them; never bypass with raw primitives.
- **Regex from user input must be escaped**: use `MongoCriteriaConverter.escapeRegex()` before building a `RegExp`.
- **Exception details stay internal**: log internally; never send `details` or stack traces in HTTP responses.

## Persistent Memory with Engram

At the start of each session, call `mem_current_project` to verify the detected project and `mem_context` to retrieve the context from previous sessions.
At the end of each session, call `mem_session_summary` with a summary of what was accomplished.

## Post-Compaction

If the context was compacted, immediately execute:

1. `mem_current_project` — confirm project
2. `mem_context` — retrieve context from previous sessions
3. `mem_search "current task"` — search for memory relevant to the work in progress
