## Activation Contract

Use this skill when dealing with CI pipelines. Currently, this project uses Jenkins, but specific configuration details are not yet documented. 

## Hard Rules (NEVER Break)

- **No GitHub Actions**: Do not assume or generate `.github/workflows`. The project uses Jenkins.

## Output Contract

Acknowledge that CI is managed via Jenkins and request further configuration details from the user if pipeline code is needed.
